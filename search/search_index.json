Ideally, Maestro should be used by games that implement dedicated game server (dgs) architecture. Each game room is a dedicated game server that runs in a match execution context, a group of game rooms is organized in a Scheduler. Each time that a user requires some change in the Scheduler or game room, Maestro creates an Operation that is a change unit that will be enqueued and handled sequentially by a proper worker related exclusively to its respective Scheduler, in other words, each Scheduler has a worker that sequentially handles Operations that is created to it.</p> <p>A Scheduler defines the requirements of a game room as to how much memory and CPU it will need to execute and other information.</p> <p>Each Operation has its own properties to be executed.</p> <p>Maestro has five components: Management API, Game Rooms API, Execution Worker, Runtime Watcher and Metrics Reporter. They all deliver together the Maestro features that will be described in the next sections.</p>"},{"location":"#features-components","title":"Features &amp; Components","text":"<p>Maestro is composed by:</p> <ul> <li>Management API: this is the component that the users will use to create your requests to interact with Maestro. For example: create a Scheduler, get Scheduler information, etc.</li> <li>Execution Worker: have an execution component to handle Operations to each Scheduler. For example: three Schedulers will have each one an execution component.</li> <li>Game Rooms API: game rooms API exposes an HTTP API or a GRPc service to receive game rooms messages that symbolize their respective status. For example: when a game room is ready to receive matches it will send a message informing that.</li> <li>Runtime Watcher: is a component in Maestro that listen to Runtime events and reflect them in Maestro. For example: when a game room was created it is notified that this event happened.</li> <li>Metrics Reporter: time spaced this component query the Runtime for metrics related to rooms and expose them in an open metrics route.
