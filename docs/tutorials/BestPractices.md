# Maestro Schedulers' best practices

## Scheduler rollouts

This document defines best practices for games on how to operate Maestro during schedulerâ€™s transitions to avoid occurrences of no rooms available.
As a rule of thumb, the lower the maxSurge, the safer the rollout. Maestro creates and removes fewer % rooms (compared to the total) in each iteration (1 min interval by default). Thus, a maxSurge of 10% will take ~10-20 minutes to complete the rollout. If time is not a constraint, aim to use a lower maxSurge to ensure the smoothest process during major rollouts (any change within spec).

### 1. When Changing Schedulers:

#### Gradual Rollout:

**Scenario:** Players are gradually joining a new scheduler, possibly due to an Android or iOS canary release.

**Recommendation:** Increase the ready target to at least 40%. This ensures sufficient capacity during the transition, reducing the risk of room shortages as the new scheduler ramps up.

#### Forced Rollout:

**Scenario:** Players will be manually disconnected from the current scheduler, and all new matches will be routed to the new scheduler.

**Recommendation:** Set the minimum number of rooms to match or exceed the baseline of the previous scheduler. This provides a buffer to maintain stability during the transition.

### 2. Post-Rollout Adjustments:

#### Rollback Ready Target / Min Room Count:

Once the rollout has finished, you can rollback the ready target and/or minimum number of rooms to their standard levels.


## Recommended defaults for games

This section outlines a few recommended defaults games that uses Maestro.These are only recommendations, and they can definitely change if your game's requirements change. Use them as a guideline to define what works best for you.

###  Minimum number of rooms

When defining the minimum number of rooms for a scheduler, one good rule of thumb, is checking the rooms variation over the course of a week, and setting it as the local minimum of this eval window. Ex.: let's say, that during the span of a week, the scheduler had the following amount of rooms:

| Day         | Rooms |
|--------------|--------|
| day 1        | 100 rooms     |
| day 2        | 50 rooms     | 
| day 3 |  25 rooms |
| day 4 | 50 rooms  |
| day 5        | 100 rooms   |
| day 6 |  100 rooms  |
| day 7 | 50 rooms  |

Min rooms should be 25, since it was the smallest value during the evaluation window.

They were defined by getting the minimum number of rooms that each region had during a 1 week avaliation window.
