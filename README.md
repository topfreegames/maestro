Maestro: Kubernetes Game Room Scheduler 
=======================================

[![Build Status](https://github.com/topfreegames/maestro/actions/workflows/test.yaml/badge.svg?branch=next)](https://github.com/topfreegames/maestro/actions/workflows/test.yaml)
[![Codecov Status](https://codecov.io/gh/topfreegames/maestro/branch/next/graph/badge.svg?token=KCN2SZDRJF)](https://codecov.io/gh/topfreegames/maestro)

## Docs
All documentation regarding this version (v10.x, AKA NEXT) can be accessed at https://topfreegames.github.io/maestro/.

## Dependencies

> **âš  WARNING: Ensure using cgroupv1**
> K3s needs to use the deprecated `cgroupv1`, to successfully run the project in your machine ensure that your current docker use this version.

### Grpc gateway
In order to run make generate with success, you need to have grpc-gateway dependencies installed with the following command:
```shell
go install \
    github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway \
    github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-openapiv2 \
    google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go \
    google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc
```

### Golang version
The project requires golang version 1.16 or higher.

## Building and running locally
1. Run `make setup` to get all required modules
2. Run `make generate` to generate mocks, protos and wire (dependency injection)
3. Run `make deps/up` to startup service dependencies
4. Run `make migrate` to migrate database with the most updated schema

### Management API Flavor
To start the management-api flavor locally, run:
```
make run/management-api
```

To test if the service (with dependencies) is up and running, try to create a scheduler by running the following command:
```
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8080/schedulers' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "name": "scheduler-test",
    "game": "test",
    "version": "v1.1",
    "terminationGracePeriod": "100",
    "maxSurge": "10",
    "containers": [
        {
            "name": "example",
            "image": "alpine:3.15.0",
            "imagePullPolicy": "Always",
            "command": ["sh", "-c", "while true; do sleep 1; done"],
            "environment": [],
            "requests": {
                "memory": "20Mi",
                "cpu": "10m"
            },
            "limits": {
                "memory": "20Mi",
                "cpu": "10m"
            },
            "ports": [
                {
                    "name": "default",
                    "protocol": "tcp",
                    "port": 80,
                    "hostPort": 80
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "portRange": {
        "start": 0,
        "end": 100
    }
}'
```

### Worker Flavor
To start the worker flavor locally, run:
```
make run/worker
```

If you've create a scheduler following the last steps of `management-api` test, starting the worker will execute the `create_scheduler` operation, you can check if the operation is executed by executing the following command:
```
export KUBECONFIG=$(pwd)/kubeconfig.yaml
kubectl get namespaces | grep zooba
```

### Runtime watcher flavor
To start the runtime watcher flavor locally, run:
```
make run/runtime-watcher
```

## Running tests

1. Run `make run/unit-tests` to run all unit tests
2. Run `make run/integration-tests` to run all integration tests
3. Run `make run/e2e-tests` to run all E2E tests. NOTE: Currently it is not
   possible to run it with the development environment set. This command will
   stop the dev dependencies before running.
4. Run `make lint` to run all registered linters
